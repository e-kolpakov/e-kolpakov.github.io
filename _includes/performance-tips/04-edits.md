Sometimes you can make a great indirect impact by investing little effort. These might feel not very valuable, 
and even useless for performance review. However, those things could be the most valuable things 
you do (think averting crises before they happen, or steering projects towards much better outcomes) - just need to 
accumulate critical mass to show it.
