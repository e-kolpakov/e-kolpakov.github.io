Launching a critical system, especially based on novel technology and/or design approach is a risky operation - 
there're a lot of unknown unknowns that risk materializing into devastating outages, data corruption, and other
serious issues. However, many of those unknowns can be found and mitigated before the system takes flight - 
via load tests, canary release, A/B testing, or "dark launch".

Mitigating all the risks right away might not be possible - but this is not always necessary. Quite often, it is 
enough to bring their potential impact to a manageable level - via reducing detection and recovery time, 
containing failure, or reducing the probability of failure. These usually come as documentation, 
instructions, or checklists, but can also take the form of scripts, additional diagnostic or administration endpoints,
or tighter monitoring.
