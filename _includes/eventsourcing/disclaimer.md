The events, systems, designs, implementations, and other information listed here are not in any way connected with 
my current work and employer. They all took place in 2017-2019 when I was part of the Capacity and 
Demand team at [Redmart][redmart] - retail grocery seller and delivery company. To the best of my knowledge, 
it does not disclose any trade secret, pending or active patent, or other kinds of protected intellectual property - 
and instead focuses on my (and my team's) experience using tools and techniques described. Most of it was already 
publicly shared via meetups, presentations, and knowledge transfer sessions.
