The events, systems, designs, implementations and other information listed here are not in any way connected with my 
current work and employer. They all took place in years 2017-2019, when I was a part of Capacity and Demand team 
at [Redmart][redmart] - retail groceries seller and delivery company. To the best of my knowledge, it does not 
disclose any trade secret, pending or active patent or other kind of protected intellectual property - and instead 
focuses on my (and my team's) experience using tools and techniques described. Most of it was already publicly shared
via meetups, presentations and knowledge transfer sessions.
