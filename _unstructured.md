The goal of any distributed system is to provide better availability, throughput, data durability, and other 
non-functional concerns, compared to functionally similar non-distributed system. As always, there's no silver bullet 
or free lunch and these improvements come at a cost - be it weaker consistency, increased deployment and maintenance 
complexity, restrictions in programming model and/or data structures, or all the above and something else on top.
