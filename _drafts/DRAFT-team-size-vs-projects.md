TBD: abstract

# Whys
* Minimize context-switching
* Ongoing support takes at most 1 person full-time (otherwise team's codebase health is in bad shape - invest into
  it first)
* One-man projects are not allowed, so at least 2-3 people on a single project

# Definitions

**Project:** somechunk of work that can be reasonably done within 1-2 quarters by 2-3-4 people.  

**Evolutionary:** New features for existing system(s). New systems in a familiar domain and tech stack.

**Revolutionary:** Rebuilding systems from scratch (aka v2). New systems in an unfamiliar domain or tech stack. 
Large-scale (system-level) refactorings (e.g. migrating from REST to queue-based communication).

**Moonshot:** high-risk high-reward projects - new product lines, projects without clear "guaranteed-to-work" solution, etc.

**Interactions:** 
* "natural" work related - working on the same feature, code reviewing, agreeing on interaction contract between systems,
    design review, etc.
* "synthetic" work related - doing some team ceremonies together - standup, planning, retrospective, demo, etc.
* "social" - non-work related interactions: common interests, having meals together, sports/games, team building events, 
    etc.

# Team sizes

## 1-3 people

Can do: support, 1 evolutionary project _or_  1 revolutionary project

Communication overhead: near zero

Atmosphere: tightly knit, "natural" work-related interactions happen on daily basis.  

## 4-6 people (cropped 2-pizza team)

Can do: support, 1-2 evolution projects _and_ 1 revolutionary project

Communication overhead: small

Atmosphere: very close - "natural" interactions between any pair of people happen at least once in a couple of days. 

## 7-9 people (2 pizza team)

Can do: support, 2-3 evolution projects, 1-2 revolutionary projects or 1 "moonshot" project

Communication overhead: medium

Atmosphere: a bit more distant - "pods" of 3-4 people that have daily "natural" interactions within the group, 
and once-i-a-week-ot-two "natural" interactions with people outside the group. 

## 10-12 people (3 pizza team)

Can do: support, 2-4 evolution, 1-2 revolutionary and 1 "moonshot" project

Communication overhead: large

Atmosphere: distant - "pods" become more prominent, with "cross-pod" interactions being rare (once in 2-4 weeks). Some
people might only meet for all-team events and team building.

## 13+

Can do all, but might as well split into 2 "normal" 2-pizza teams.

Communications overhead: large

Atmosphere: disjoint - multiple isolated pods appear almost inevitably, even if there's conscious effort to avoid that.
